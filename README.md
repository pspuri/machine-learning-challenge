Machine Learning Homework 
Ran models for predicting if a planet will be an Exoplanet.  Outcome will be "{FALSE POSITIVE':2,'CONFIRMED':1,'CANDIDATE':3}"

The two models that showed the highest probability were the Random Forest and Keras.  Attached are the Jupyter notebooks for all the models using multi variable regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, and SVC.  

Started with cleaning data and doing "one hot encoding" where necessary.  The classifications were changed to vectors from string.  

next steps would be to do feature tuning and optimizing the models.
